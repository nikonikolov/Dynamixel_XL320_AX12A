# Dynamixel_XL320_AX12A

Communication protocol between an Arduino Board and Dynamixel Servo XL-320/Ax-12A. 
Implementation of the XL-320 library is independent of the AX-12A library and vice versa.

To be able to compile include both
<code>DNXServo.h</code>

and the specific library you need
<code>XL320.h</code>
and/or
<code>AX12A.h</code>

in your arduino sketch.
