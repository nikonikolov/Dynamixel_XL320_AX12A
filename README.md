# Dynamixel_XL320_AX12A

Communication protocol between an Arduino Board and Dynamixel Servo XL-320/Ax-12A. 
Implementation of the XL-320 library is independent of the AX-12A library and vice versa.

To be able to compile include both
#include <DNXServo.h>

and the specific library you need
#include <XL320.h>
and/or
#include <AX12A.h>

in your arduino sketch.
