# Dynamixel_XL320_AX12A

Communication protocol between an Arduino Board and Dynamixel Servo XL-320/Ax-12A. 
Implementation of the XL-320 library is independent of the AX-12A library and vice versa.

To be able to compile include both
<code> #include<DNXServo.h> </code>

and the specific library you need
<code> #include<XL320.h> </code>
and/or
<code> #include<AX12A.h> </code>

in your arduino sketch.
