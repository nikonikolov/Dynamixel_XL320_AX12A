Dynamixel library - mbed
========

A simple example is provided in `main.cpp`. Note that `include.*` and 
`PCSerial.*` are not actually a part of the communication with the servos,
but you will need them to be able to compile the project. Their main purpose
is to provide easy to use debugging tools.
