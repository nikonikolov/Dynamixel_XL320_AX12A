Dynamixel library
========

A library for communication between an Arduino or mbed and Dynamixel Servos XL-320/AX-12A.
The library implements the Dynamixel Communication protocols v1 and v2, so it 
might work for other Dynamixel servos (this is not tested).
Note that the implementation for XL-320 is independent of that for the AX-12A servos, so you
can freely use only the part of the library you need.

Usage

Check the readme file in the folder for your target platform for further details.
